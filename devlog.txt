- Organized the repo and added design_wiki0.pdf.
Feedback received for design_wiki0.pdf:
- Generally, the diagrams and information were good.
- The component map we made for this was actually a site map. Component maps should include backend information.

- Added the description of the website/app and the launch codes to README.md.

- Housecleaning (moving things around in the repo)
- Updated component map to better show what is happening on the backend of the program
- Added flask sessions to the component map to show when the user is logged in and can edit their blog posts

- Added design_wiki1 to the repo

- added initial app skeleton for the project
- added temporary templates to serve as a login feature (will change SOON)

roshaniS -- 2021-10-30 18:08
- Added additional templates (register.html, userblog.html)
- Modified templates to match variables in __init__.py
- Modified __init__.py so that it could create a simple working site with login capabilities

- Added back actual design_wiki0.pdf
- Fixed because the previous pdf was actually of the first version of our design document (for the web log hosting site)
- Feedback from that design wiki document is in my first devlog entry

- Added correct design_wiki1.pdf
  - Feedback:
    - Most the design document lacked the needed clarity to proceed (components, database organization, maps)
    - Site map was too tiny to read
- Updated requirements.txt so that user can use the file to install the required packages

thomasY -- 2021-10-31 18:54
- Updated README with more detailed launch codes

thomasY -- 2021-10-31 21:27
- Fixed issues with launch codes
  - Wasn't in the correct directory when installing requirements
  - Replaced pip with pip3

austinN -- 2021-11-01 09:22
- added initial skeleton for database creation of users and their login info

roshaniS -- 2021-11-01 19:03
- Added loginpage.py to display the login and register pages
- Moved the code from __init__.py to loginpage.py but kept the original code in __init__.py (will change this soon)
- Modified the code so that logging in would allow the user to stay at the root
- Removed the condition for "GET" 
- Added the register button and the functions associated with it (did not include the username/password checks using the database yet; only used hardcoded             username/password, but will change soon)
- Fixed the logout function so that it redirects the user to the root and not just renders the login.html template
- There is still an error with the site after the user registers successfully; since the user is still on the /auth route, the user can only keep registering on the   login page that is rendered after registering the first time. The user cannot login normally.

roshaniS -- 2021-11-01 19:07
- Fixed the errors that were present in loginpage.py ("UnboundLocalError: local variable 'tempUser' referenced before assignment")
  - These errors were present in the disp_loginpage() and authenticate() functions
  - Moved the sections of code after tempUser and tempPass were assigned back under the if statement checking if request.method == 'POST' 
  - In the disp_loginpage() function: all the code below the variable assignments mentioned above up until "if "user" in session"
  - In the authenticate() function: all the code below the variable assignments mentioned above up until the end of the function
